## I.L.A. the Intelligent Learning Assistant

This is a fork of a "fork" of my old I.L.A. voice-assistant project.
@hersche was so nice to copy it over from https://sites.google.com/site/ilavoiceassistant/ and thus saved the files since the links on the project page seem to be broken for a while now (and I did not even notice o_O).

ILA has not been changed in the past 3 years, but there is a new member in the family called SEPIA, check it out:

## Original readme by @hersche

This is a fork of the ILA-Voice-Assistant (based Beta v3.8) from a nice developer named Florian. Because of the last update was in 2015 and the code doesn't seem to be in a version control, i like to put it on github. It already works well with *buntu 16.10, i am impressed. Train sphinx4/pocketsphinx is a dream there. 

sphinx4 seems precompiled, for updates in sphinx i will try stuff there.

I use it since a short time but i'm impressed how easy you could set it to the own voice.

Since i speak mainly german and ILA does support german and english, i really like it too.

One point of my development is to train ILA for more questions. If people fork it, we could easily teach the system new sentences.

When the development goes deeper, we may also could integrate more languages. 

On the homepage is a developer-package as well, which is not integrated here in a first moment - i'm looking for teaching it new stuff first.

When the right place for the sources is found, i will integrate it.

Another small target for me personaly is it to use services with more privacy.

First changes here:

- More sentences, mostly in the german part
- Changed google to searx.me and bing to searx.at (basicly)
- replaced maps.google partialy by openstreetmap
